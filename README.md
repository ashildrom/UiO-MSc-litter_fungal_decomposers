### Methodological information
DNA extraction performed on 150 mg spruce litter per sample, PCR amplified and library prepared. Three libraries were paired-end sequenced using ITS2 at Fasteris, Switzerland. Raw sequences were demultiplexed using CUTADAPT, minimum overlap 26 bp, minimum read length 100 bp. Denoising and dereplicating sequences using DADA2, maximum two errors per read for both forward and reverse reads. ASV table produced and ITS2 region extracted using ITSx. ASV´s clustered into OTU´s using VSEARCH with a 97% sequence similarity threshold. Post-clustering performed using MUMU. Taxonomic annotation with a 0.8 certainty cut-off value using SINTAX.
